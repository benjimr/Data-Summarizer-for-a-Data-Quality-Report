A program designed to analyse a dataset and provide summary data regarding both categorical and continuous data in the form of a CSV file. The summary data includes means, medians, modes, cardinality and more. This data can be used as part of a data quality report to easily see potential issues/problems so they can be caught early and quickly.

This program uses pandas and numpy to achieve this analysis.
